Pentimento is a utility to help show progress events in the terminal.

## Example

Here is a complete working example. Each iteration of the loop overwrites the
previous output from the printer so only the current information stays on-screen.

This pattern can be adapted to show outstanding tasks, current external event progress,
or multiple progress bars (à la `docker pull`). The implementation uses ANSI codes, so
beware of backing writers that do not support them.

See the file `main.go` in the example directory of this project for a working example.

The output of this example can be viewed here:
