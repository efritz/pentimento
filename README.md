Pentimento is a utility to help show progress events in the terminal.

## Example

Here is a complete working example. Each iteration of the loop overwrites the
previous output from the printer so only the current information stays on-screen.

This pattern can be adapted to show outstanding tasks, current external event progress,
or multiple progress bars (Ã  la `docker pull`). The implementation uses ANSI codes, so
beware of backing writers that do not support them.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"

	"github.com/efritz/pentimento"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Printf("Before\n")

	pentimento.PrintProgress(func(p *pentimento.Printer) {
		for i := 1; i <= 10; i++ {
			content := pentimento.NewContent()
			content.AddLine("[%s] a %d", pentimento.Throbber, i)
			content.AddLine("[%s] b %d", pentimento.Spinner, i)
			content.AddLine("[%s] c %d", pentimento.Throbber, i)
			p.WriteContent(content)

			<-time.After(time.Second / 2)
		}

		p.Reset()
		p.WriteString("Done")
	})

	fmt.Printf("After\n")
}
```
